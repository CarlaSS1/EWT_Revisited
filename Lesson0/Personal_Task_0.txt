Personal Time log for Project: Archiver 2019.

What is Project: Archiver 2019?
It's a project where I compile the funniest parts of recordings that I have made during voice calls throughout 2019.
Had this project in the back burner since I had personal things to take care as well.

While this task is not too practical, it helps me figure out what I need to consider when making a personal task for the remaining lessons.
